## Tips 
1. Don't directly push to the master branch ( work on your branch and give a PR (pull-request) to any one of us)
2. Feel free to use any npm libraries
3. Preferred to construct react functional components (rather than Class components) 
4. Use Hooks (some major hooks are useState, useRef, useLoction). 

## Environment
Try VScode. Will be easy to work with Git
